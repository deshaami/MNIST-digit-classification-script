# MNIST Digit Classification Using CNN

## üìå Project Summary  
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately identify digits (0 through 9) from grayscale images of handwritten numbers by leveraging deep learning techniques.

## üß† How It Works  
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each sized 28x28 pixels. A CNN architecture is designed to extract hierarchical features from these images by applying convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers to perform classification.

Transfer learning is not used here; instead, a custom CNN is built from scratch to demonstrate core deep learning concepts for image recognition. The model learns to distinguish patterns such as edges, curves, and shapes that define each digit.

Key components include:  
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features from images.  
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample feature maps to reduce computation and capture spatial invariance.  
- **Dropout:** A regularization technique to reduce overfitting.  
- **Softmax Activation:** Converts final outputs into probabilities for each digit class.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview  
- **Dataset:** MNIST handwritten digits  
- **Training samples:** 60,000  
- **Test samples:** 10,000  
- **Image size:** 28x28 pixels, grayscale  
- **Labels:** Integers from 0 to 9 representing digits

## üîç Training and Evaluation  
The CNN model is trained for 15 epochs using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. A portion of the training data is used for validation to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.

The training process involves feeding images forward through the network, computing loss, and adjusting weights via backpropagation. After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its generalization capabilities.

Metrics such as accuracy and loss are tracked and visualized to understand the learning progress and identify any issues like underfitting or overfitting.

## ‚úÖ Results  
The model achieves high accuracy on both training and test datasets, often exceeding 98%, demonstrating effective learning and reliable digit classification performance. This makes it suitable as a baseline for further experimentation or deployment in handwritten digit recognition applications.

## üí° Applications  
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for digit extraction  
- Automated form processing and digit entry  
- Educational tools for learning machine learning and CNNs  
- Real-time digit recognition in embedded systems or mobile apps

## üß∞ How to Run  
1. Prepare the MNIST dataset (can be automatically downloaded via libraries like TensorFlow/Keras).  
2. Implement or use the CNN architecture to train on the dataset.  
3. Evaluate and test the model on unseen handwritten digits.  
4. Optionally, fine-tune hyperparameters or extend the model for better accuracy.
